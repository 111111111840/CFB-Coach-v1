        In College Football Coach, you take the role of a newly hired coach at your college of choice.
        As coach, it will be your responsibility to manage your team\'s strategy, simulate through seasons, recruit new players, and above all, win championships.\n\n

        DYNASTY MODE: Dynasty mode allows you to start with any team and build it into the best football dynasty you can. You will not get fired, however, other colleges may see changes in their staff.
        Every other feature is unlocked except user contracts. You can also switch universities via the Editor menu. \n\n
        CAREER MODE: Career mode puts you in the shoes of a new head coach trying to build your way up to stardom. If you perform well, your coaching attributes increase, your talent pool increases,
        and you will be offered contract extensions. If you perform poorly, you will lose coaching attributes, and potentially risk losing your job and be on the streets applying for a new position.\n
        This Mode has two starting points: NORMAL mode, which lets you start at any university, and CHALLENGE mode, which humbly starts you at a smaller school and makes your work to get to the top.
        \n\n

        Developer Notes:\n\n
        The original version of this game was created by Achi Jones in 2016. He graciously made this game open-source on Github and allowed it to be tinkered with. In Fall of 2017, I took
        the source code and expanded upon it for Android devices. The game now features several new features including expanded universe, improved realism, career mode, and in-game editor.

    <string name="tutPlayingSeason">
        Your team will play 12 games in the regular season, which consist of playing all 9 of your conference opponents once and three out of conference games.
        By navigating to the GAMES tab, you can see exactly what your team\'s schedule is.
        And by clicking on each game, you can see a scouting report of the two teams (if the game has yet to be played), or a summary of the game (if it was already played).\n\n
        The most important game of the regular season is your rivalry game, which you gain prestige if won or lose prestige if lost.
        At the end of the regular season, the Conference Championship is played between the two teams with the best in-conference record.
        If two teams have the same record, a head-to-head tiebreaker is used. If three or more teams have the same record, the one with the highest poll ranking is chosen.
        After the Conference Championships, Bowl Games are played.\n\n
        The top 32 teams get chosen for a bowl, with the most important being the National Semifinals between the #1 and #4 team, and the #2 and #3 team.
        The winner of these two games advance to the National Championship where an undisputed champion is crowned.\n\n
        After the season, your team will have gained or lost prestige based on their results versus their expectations, and you move onto recruiting.
    </string>
    <string name="tutRankings">
        As your team plays through the season, it will be evaluated by pollsters who determine how good (or bad) your team is compared to others.
        This "Poll Ranking" is determined by wins, margin of victory, strength of schedule, and more, and has a big impact on how your season will play out,
        as it determines who gets into a bowl game and the semifinals.\n\nMany statistics are kept track of during the season, such as Yards Per Game, Opposing Points Per Game,
        Pass Yards Per Game, Turnover Differential and more. You can view all these statistics, as well as your team\'s ranking in each one, by navigating to the "STATS" tab.
    </string>
    <string name="tutRoster">
        When you first inherit a team, you will have a total of 46 players (22 starters) on your roster. Each player has a name, their year in school (from Freshman to Senior),
        an Overall rating, Potential rating, and three position specific ratings. The Overall rating is just a composite rating of the three position specific ones, while Potential
        determines how much each play improves during the offseason. You can view all of these players in the "ROSTER" tab.\n

    <string name="tutTeamStrategy">
        As a coach, you can pick what strategy your team employs on offense and defense as they play through their season. By default both strategies are set to balanced offenses and defenses,
        meaning there are no bonuses or penalties either way. But you can change your strategy to any of the following:\n
        \n
        [Offense] Pro-Style:\n
        -Balanced offense\n
        -50/50 play calling\n
        -No Strengths or weaknesses\n
        \n
        [Offense] Smash Mouth:\n
        -Run heavy offense\n
        -60/40 rushing play calls\n
        -Blocking bonuses, shorter gains, more time off the playclock\n
        \n
        [Offense] West Coast:\n
        -Favor passing over rushing\n
        -60/40 passing play calls\n
        -Blocking bonuses, shorter gains, more time off the playclock\n
        \n
        [Offense] Spread:\n
        -Pass heavy offense\n
        -72 pct passing play calls\n
        -Weaker blocking, bigger play potential\n
        \n
        [Offense] Read Option:\n
        -Favors run over pass - requires mobile QB\n
        -55 pct rushing play calls\n
        -Weaker blocking, bigger play potential\n
        \n
        [Defense] 4-3:\n
        - Balanced base man defense\n
        - No bonuses or weaknesses\n
        \n
        [Defense] 4-6 Bear:\n
        - Defensive scheme with emphasis on limiting the run\n
        - Gives up less rushing yards, however secondary is susceptible to giving up big plays\n
        \n
        [Defense] Cover 2:\n
        - Zone coverage set up to stop passing games underneath\n
        - Improves pass coverage, however may allow for bigger rushes\n
        \n
        [Defense] Cover 3:\n
        - Zone coverage scheme set up to stop big passing plays\n
        - Significantly improves passing coverage and stops long balls\n
        - May allow big rushing gains\n

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

        In College Football Coach, you take the role of a newly hired coach at your college of choice.
        As coach, it will be your responsibility to manage your team\'s strategy, simulate through seasons, recruit new players, and above all, win championships.\n\n

        DYNASTY MODE: Dynasty mode allows you to start with any team and build it into the best football dynasty you can. You will not get fired, however, other colleges may see changes in their staff.
        Every other feature is unlocked except user contracts. You can also switch universities via the Editor menu. \n\n
        CAREER MODE: Career mode puts you in the shoes of a new head coach trying to build your way up to stardom. If you perform well, your coaching attributes increase, your talent pool increases,
        and you will be offered contract extensions. If you perform poorly, you will lose coaching attributes, and potentially risk losing your job and be on the streets applying for a new position.\n
        This Mode has two starting points: NORMAL mode, which lets you start at any university, and CHALLENGE mode, which humbly starts you at a smaller school and makes your work to get to the top.

        Developer Notes:\n\n
        The original version of this game was created by Achi Jones in 2016. He graciously made this game open-source on Github and allowed it to be tinkered with. In Fall of 2017, I took
        the source code and expanded upon it for Android devices. The game now features several new features including expanded universe, improved realism, career mode, and in-game editor.

    <string name="tutPlayingSeason">
        Your team will play 12 games in the regular season, which consist of playing all 9 of your conference opponents once and three out of conference games.
        By navigating to the GAMES tab, you can see exactly what your team\'s schedule is.
        And by clicking on each game, you can see a scouting report of the two teams (if the game has yet to be played), or a summary of the game (if it was already played).\n\n
        The most important game of the regular season is your rivalry game, which you gain prestige if won or lose prestige if lost.
        At the end of the regular season, the Conference Championship is played between the two teams with the best in-conference record.
        If two teams have the same record, a head-to-head tiebreaker is used. If three or more teams have the same record, the one with the highest poll ranking is chosen.
        After the Conference Championships, Bowl Games are played.\n\n
        The top 32 teams get chosen for a bowl, with the most important being the National Semifinals between the #1 and #4 team, and the #2 and #3 team.
        The winner of these two games advance to the National Championship where an undisputed champion is crowned.\n\n
        After the season, your team will have gained or lost prestige based on their results versus their expectations, and you move onto recruiting.

    <string name="tutRankings">
        As your team plays through the season, it will be evaluated by pollsters who determine how good (or bad) your team is compared to others.
        This "Poll Ranking" is determined by wins, margin of victory, strength of schedule, and more, and has a big impact on how your season will play out,
        as it determines who gets into a bowl game and the semifinals.\n\nMany statistics are kept track of during the season, such as Yards Per Game, Opposing Points Per Game,
        Pass Yards Per Game, Turnover Differential and more. You can view all these statistics, as well as your team\'s ranking in each one, by navigating to the "STATS" tab.

    <string name="tutRoster">
        When you first inherit a team, you will have a total of 46 players (22 starters) on your roster. Each player has a name, their year in school (from Freshman to Senior),
        an Overall rating, Potential rating, and three position specific ratings. The Overall rating is just a composite rating of the three position specific ones, while Potential
        determines how much each play improves during the offseason. You can view all of these players in the "ROSTER" tab.\n

    <string name="tutTeamStrategy">
        As a coach, you can pick what strategy your team employs on offense and defense as they play through their season. By default both strategies are set to balanced offenses and defenses,
        meaning there are no bonuses or penalties either way. But you can change your strategy to any of the following:\n
        \n
        [Offense] Pro-Style:\n
        -Balanced offense\n
        -50/50 play calling\n

        -Run heavy offense\n
        -60/40 rushing play calls\n
        -Blocking bonuses, shorter gains, more time off the playclock\n
        \n

        \n

        -Pass heavy offense\n
        -72 pct passing play calls\n
        -Weaker blocking, bigger play potential\n
        \n

        -Favors run over pass - requires mobile QB\n

10-18
Two versions released:
(A) bug fix to stop game crashing at national title week. this was caused by players without first names. also several tweaks to the game engine, and display fixes on stats.

(TEST-B)
"test" one is another big update, requiring new start. I'll keep both versions on, but new one includes new game sim options: i.e. screen passes to RB, QB scramble out of pressure, and more stats: RB receiving stats obviously, but also CB passes defended/pct. I also started adding new rating categories for every player though I havent utilized all of them yet. I'm also thinking of some under the hood OL stats that will be used to rate them, such as sacks allowed, total offense when on the field, etc.
